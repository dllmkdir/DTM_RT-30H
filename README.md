Acoustic Drum Trigger Module with Arduino and Processing.
In this project, we set Arduino capabilities to the limitin order to give a good performance for the dru trigger sensors.

This Drum Trigger Module can support three acoustic sensors at the same time. Every sensor can be tweaked by the navigation control featured in this implementation. Also the module is designed to give high accuracy and sensibility in order to achieve a good level of musicality. Drum trigger modules are expensive and bulky; This module is cheap and it gets the principal characteristics well executed. Work is still in progress.
